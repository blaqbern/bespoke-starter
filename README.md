# Bespoke Starter

## WIP

This is a starter kit for Bespoke.js that works with html or Markdown files or React components. The idea came from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/sokra/1be6f6f5eee72db39664). Thanks and credit to [sokra](https://github.com/sokra).

Also a special thanks to [akatopo](https://github.com/akatopo) for the [theme](https://github.com/akatopo/bespoke-theme-build-wars).
